# Goal
Learn ML: both Eng & DS aspects.
I for now want to start from Eng aspect.


# Resources
## fast.ai
Start from setting up project & dive deep into training aspects.

## Hugging Face - NLP Course
Pre-req: fast.ai

## Deeplearning.ai
Perhaps at same level as fast.ai
Goes quickly into Math/DS

## [KrishNaik Grand complete DS material](https://github.com/krishnaik06/The-Grand-Complete-Data-Science-Materials)
Pretty detailed, can get Eng perspective.

# Plan
Fast.ai then may be transition to KrishNaik or HuggingFace
