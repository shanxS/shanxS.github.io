I wanted to create backup of my stuff with version control. So I got a disk and init a git repo, rsync'd my stuff and when I tried to add that to git repo, it took long, long enough to make me impatient and figure better way of doing it.

Turns out git repo prerformance starts to hit brick wall when repo size is around [200GB and doesn't play well with file size over a GB](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/devops/2017/02/03/announcing-gvfs-git-virtual-file-system/).

My use case is of repo size around 1TB and there may be files upto or more than a GB. I am looking for some simple solution. And I dont care DCVS or CVS. So I compared svn and hg next.

SVN wanted me to have a server to even being with - nope, dont have time for that.

HG, although similar to git, performed really well. Add and Commit operations of ~24GB of files took few minutes. Log and Status operation was also fast enogh to not make me impatiient (I know that's not a metric, but hey this is not a benchmarking blog anyway)

Plus, limits of HG seems to be [better](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/HandlingLargeFiles)
